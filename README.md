# hog.net
A Harry Potter themed querying exercise based on Zim

# Instructions

Welcome to hog.net – the local network of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You have been tasked with answering the following research questions by querying the databases available on the local school network:

* books – soft copies of select books from the school library
* comp – personal computers of hog.net users
* e-owl – the magical equivalent of email
* floochat – instant messaging logs between hog.net users (based on the FLOO protocol)
* news – news reports and articles from the international wizarding community
* users – information about hog.net users

It is recommended that you read all questions prior to solving the exercise. You can fill in your answers in the text boxes in this document. Be sure to include references in footnotes and use proper estimative language (“probably”, “possibly”, etc.).

If you’d like to contribute to this project, please fill out the self-assessment and feedback form once you have completed the exercise.
