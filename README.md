# hog.net

Welcome to hog.net, a "Harry Potter" themed querying exercise based on [Zim](https://zim-wiki.org/), in which you explore the local network of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this exercise, you are tasked with answering research questions by querying the databases available on the local school network:

* books – soft copies of select books from the school library
* comp – personal computers of hog.net users
* e-owl – the magical equivalent of email
* floochat – instant messaging logs between hog.net users (based on the FLOO protocol)
* news – news reports and articles from the international wizarding community
* users – information about hog.net users
