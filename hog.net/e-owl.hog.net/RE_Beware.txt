Sybill,

In case you have forgotten (again), I happen to teach Quidditch for a living - I use a broom nearly every day.

If your (somewhat unprompted, I must admit) reading of my coffee cup has shown you this dire fate, I fear I must simply accept it as an occupational hazard.

Wishing you well,
Rolanda

Dear Prof. Hooch,

I happened to pass by your coffee mug this morning during breakfast just as I was leaving the professorsâ€™ lounge, and I immediately noticed that the swirl of your milk clearly indicates you have been doomed to die a horrible death in a deadly accident involving a broom!

I therefore beg that you avoid brooms in the future at all costs!

All the best,
Sybill
