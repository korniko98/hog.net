====== Tongue-Tying Curse ======
The Tongue-Tying Curse (Mimblewimble), also known as the Tongue-Tying Spell, is a curse that ties the target's tongue in a knot, preventing them from making coherent speech. This feature also allows one to prevent the victim from speaking the incantations of spells correctly, and hence like the Silencing Charm it is useful in duelling.
