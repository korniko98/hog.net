====== Silencing Charm ======
The Silencing Charm (Silencio) is a charm that renders the victim temporarily mute. Working on both beasts and beings, it is immensely difficult to perform, more so on ravens than frogs. If performed incorrectly, the target will swell up to an immense size and begin making deafening sounds.
