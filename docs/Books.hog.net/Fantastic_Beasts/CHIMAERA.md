The Chimaera is a rare Greek monster with a lion’s head, a goat’s body and a dragon’s tail. Vicious and bloodthirsty, the Chimaera is extremely dangerous. There is only one known instance of the successful slaying of a Chimaera and the unlucky wizard concerned fell to his death from his winged horse shortly afterwards, exhausted by his efforts. Chimaera eggs are blue, perfectly round, and classified as Grade A Non-Tradeable Goods.
