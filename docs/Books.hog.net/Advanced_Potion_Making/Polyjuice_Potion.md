# Polyjuice Potion  
The Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to assume the form of someone else. It is highly complicated, challenging and time-consuming to brew.  
  
The recipe to make the Polyjuice Potion is as follows:  
  
  
1. Add 3 measures of fluxweed to the cauldron (must have been picked on a full moon).  
2. Add 2 bundles of knotgrass to the cauldron.  
3. Stir 4 times, clockwise.  
4. Wave your wand then let potion brew for 80 minutes (for a Pewter Cauldron. A Brass Cauldron will only require 68, and a copper one only 60.  
5. Add 4 leeches to the cauldron.  
6. Add 2 scoops of lacewing flies to the mortar, crush to a fine paste, then add 2 measures of the crushed lacewings to the cauldron.  
7. Heat for 30 seconds on a low heat.  
8. Wave your wand to complete this stage of the potion.  
9. Add 3 measures of boomslang skin to the cauldron.  
10. Add 1 measure of bicorn horn to the mortar, crush to a fine powder, then add one measure of the crushed horn to the cauldron.  
11. Heat for 20 seconds at a high temperature.  
12. Wave your wand then let potion brew for 24 hours (for a Pewter Cauldron. A Brass Cauldron will only require 1224 minutes, and a copper one only 18 hours).  
13. Add 1 additional scoop of lacewings to the cauldron.  
14. Stir 3 times, counter-clockwise.  
15. Split potion into multiple doses, if desired, then add the pieces of the person you wish to become.  
16. Wave your wand to complete the potion.  
  
  
Note: Lacewing flies must be stewed for twenty-one days prior to making the potion.
