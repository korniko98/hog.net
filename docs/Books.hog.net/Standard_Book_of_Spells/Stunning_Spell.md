# Stunning Spell  
The Stunning Spell (Stupefy), also known as the Stupefying Charm, or Stunner for short, is a charm that stuns the target, rendering them unconscious. This charm is exceptionally useful in duelling, as it can quickly end a duel without causing lasting damage. The spell also has the ability to halt moving objects. The counter-charm to the Stunning Spell is the Reviving Spell.
