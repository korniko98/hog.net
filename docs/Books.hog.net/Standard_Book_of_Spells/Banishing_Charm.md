# Banishing Charm  
The Banishing Charm (Depulso) sends the target away from the caster. It can send a target towards a specific location and works on both living and inanimate things. The Banishing Charm is opposite of the Summoning Charm. Unlike the Summoning Charm, which can summon specific objects from anywhere, the Banishing Charm only banishes whatever the wand is aimed at.
