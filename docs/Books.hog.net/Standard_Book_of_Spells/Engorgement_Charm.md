# Engorgement Charm  
The Engorgement Charm (Engorgio), also known as Growing Charm, is a charm that causes the target to swell immensely. It is the counter-charm for the Shrinking Charm, causing shrunken objects to return to their original size. If the caster attempts to engorge the target beyond a certain point it will violently explode. Although this spell is safe to use on animals, its use is not recommended until the counter-charm has been perfected. A variation of this spell is Engorgio Skullus, which makes the head of a person bigger.
