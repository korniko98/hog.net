Good Afternoon,  
  
Starting tomorrow at 7 am, the hog.net EOwl server will be down for maintenance for at least 2 hours, in order to clear digital droppings and replenish our supply of voles.  
  
During this period, users may of course use the Owlery located behind the castle if they wish to send and recieve correspondence.
