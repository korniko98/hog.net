Dear Prof. Sprout and Prof. Hagrid,  
  
I was walking by the greenhouse yesterday and noticed what I initially thought was a hedgehog.  
However, after observing its behavior for a few minutes, I believe it could be a Knarl!  
I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this situation and hope it can be handled without damaging any plants.
