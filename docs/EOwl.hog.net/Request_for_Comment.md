Dear Prof. Dumbledore,  
  
As you know, I have an upcoming article concerning your snacking habits, and would like to give you one more chance to comment prior to publication.  
  
As I've mentioned countless times in the past, I would also greatly appreciate the opportunity to interview you whenever you can find the time.  
  
Eagerly awaiting your response,  
Rita Skeeter
