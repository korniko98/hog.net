<ronw\> lmao there's a wicked looking spider on my monitor and if i move the mouse around he chases after it  
<harryp\> haha ron  
<harryp\> take a screenshot  
<harryp\> wait  
<harryp\> that made no sense  
<hermioneg\> ron, aren't you afraid of spiders?...  
<ronw\> well yeah but it's just a little one  
<harryp\> guys i think i might need to go visit madam pomfrey, the boils from goyle's spell are getting really painful  
<hermioneg\> so what are you waiting for?  
<harryp\> i still haven't finished my herbology homework yet  
<harryp\> hermione any chance you could give me a hand?  
<hermioneg\> sorry harry i still haven't finished my own homework  
<harryp\> alright i'll figure something out i guess  
<harryp\> maybe there's a magical solution
