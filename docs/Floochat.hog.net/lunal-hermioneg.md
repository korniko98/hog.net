# lunal-hermioneg  
<hermioneg\> professor sprout tought us how to grow roses today  
<lunal\> i much prefer potatoes tbh  
<hermioneg\> how are roses and potatoes comparable?...  
<lunal\> roses only last like a couple weeks  
<lunal\> and that's if you leave them in water  
<lunal\> and they really only exist to be pretty  
<lunal\> so that's like saying  
<lunal\> "my love for you is transitory and based solely on your appearance"  
<lunal\> but a potato!  
<lunal\> potatos last forever  
<lunal\> in fact, not only will they not rot, they actually grow stuff even if you just leave them in the sack  
<lunal\> that part alone makes it a good symbol  
<lunal\> but there's more!  
<lunal\> there are so many ways to enjoy a potato! you can even make a battery with it!  
<lunal\> and that's like saying "i have many ways in which I show my love for you"  
<lunal\> and potatos may be ugly, but they're still amazing  
<lunal\> so that's like saying "it doesn't matter at all what you look like, I'll still love you"  
<hermioneg\> right  
<lunal\> anyway  
<lunal\> could i pick your brain about something for a moment?  
<hermioneg\> of course  
<lunal\> you know what happened to neville today?  
<hermioneg\> yeah, i heard!  
<lunal\> so i could have sworn i heard draco mumble something under his breath just before it happened  
<hermioneg\> might have been a jinx!  
<hermioneg\> what did it sound like?  
<lunal\> coroshmoo? colastoo? something like that  
<hermioneg\> that sounds awefully familiar but i can't place it, sorry  
<lunal\> oh well...
