# harryp-seamusf  
<seamusf\> I heard about this guy who broke into a hippogryph's den at the zoo  
<seamusf\> and got mauled  
<seamusf\> and people were talking about how there should have been better defences put up to prevent people getting into the cage  
<harryp\> maybe set up some kind of deterrent  
<harryp\> for example, put some sort of fierce animal in the cage, which would attack anybody who climbed in
