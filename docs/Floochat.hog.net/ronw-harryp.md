<ronw\> hey harry, did you end up going to the nurse's office?  
<harryp\> nope, i think i've got the boil situation under control actually  
<ronw\> are you sure? neville just told me he heard you groaning in agony in the dorm  
<harryp\> no need to worry  
<harryp\> turns out there's a pretty good remedy  
<harryp\>but one of the ingredients was out of stock (no idea why), so i had to improvise  
<ronw\> ...do i want to know?  
<harryp\> probably not :|  
<ronw\> alright mate, feel better!
