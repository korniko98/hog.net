<harryp\> neville, why is there a rumor going around you aren't wearing shoes these days?  
<nevillel\> hey harry, it's kind of embarrassing  
<nevillel\> i'd really rather not talk about it...  
<harryp\> oh! sorry, ok, no problem  
<harryp\> i can lend you my boots if you want  
<nevillel\> that's nice of you, maybe i'll borrow them later  
<nevillel\> thanks  
<harryp\> sure thing
