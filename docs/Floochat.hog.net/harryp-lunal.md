# harryp-lunal  
<harryp\> hey luna  
<harryp\> can i ask why neville's been wandering around without his shoes on?...  
<harryp\> i'd ask him myself but he doesn't really want to talk about it for some reason  
<lunal\> hey harry  
<lunal\> it was the strangest thing actually  
<lunal\> as we were leaving class  
<lunal\> he suddenly couldn't move his feet  
<lunal\> he nearly fell over but luckily i caught him  
<lunal\> we tried to get his shoes unstuck for a few minutes but i was afraid we would be late for herbology  
<lunal\> so we decided to just leave them there  
<lunal\> personally i think it's kind of liberating really  
<harryp\> i suppose...  
<harryp\> any idea why it happened?  
<lunal\> it might have something to do with draco  
<lunal\> i think he was out the door just ahead of us  
<lunal\> he was talking to himself and looked awefully suspicious  
<harryp\> draco always looks suspicious...
