<harryp\> no idea...  
<nevillel\> how long shall we give her  
<nevillel\> or shall we camp on the server?  
<harryp\> erm...  
<harryp\> unless the second game happens early it doesnt bother me...  
<harryp\> i might return to minecraft though... I kinda just caught the bug  
<nevillel\> cool!  
<nevillel\> I haven't played but know its addictive nature from my friends  
<harryp\> if he doesn't turn up then the final game is the decider.;;;  
<nevillel\> i guess, unless we have time to reschedule the lavender game before 27th?  
<nevillel\> don't want to deprive her fun and games :D  
<harryp\> she goes away tomorrow...
