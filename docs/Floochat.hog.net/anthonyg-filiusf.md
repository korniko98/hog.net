<anthonyg\> Good afternoon Professor Flitwick,  
<anthonyg\> I've been asked to raise a non-urgent issue to your attention and was wondering if now would be an ok time to bring it up.  
<anthonyg\> (truly not urgent)  
<filiusf\> walking into a meeting  
<filius\> I'll see your response afterwards  
<filiusf\> what's the issue you'd like to raise Mr Goldstein  
<anthonyg\> My mother wanted me to ask whether Ravenclaw can have an evening activity sometime this week in honor of international Holocaust memorial day.  
<anthonyg\> I told her that every year someone sends a nice in-depth email on the subject but she insisted that I bring it up with you.  
<anthonyg\> Good afternoon Professor, bringing up the Holocaust memorial thing again because my mother has been asking about it.  
<anthonyg\> Shall I just tell her that it's not feasible?  
<filiusf\> ah Mr Goldstein I didn't answer you on Monday  
<filiusf\> your mother sent me an email  
<anthonyg\> Sorry Professorâ€¦  
<filiusf\> quite alright. She proposed that you run an activity for Ravenclaw about your family's story which I thought was a fine idea  
<filiusf\> scheduled your talk or activity or whatever you decide for Friday 1915-2015  
<anthonyg\> Ah.  
<anthonyg\> I'm not actually sure I have the time.  
<anthonyg\> Can I get back to you on the subject later today?  
<filiusf\> your schedule doesn't look too full to me. I'm sure you'll do a fine job.  
<filiusf\> any other non-urgent issues from your mother Mr Goldstein?  
<anthonyg\> Nothing Professor  
<filiusf\> lovely
