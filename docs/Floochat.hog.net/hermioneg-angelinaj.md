# hermioneg-angelinaj  
<hermioneg\> hey angelina, could i pick your brain about something?  
<angelinaj\> yeah but i only have a few minutes  
<hermioneg\> thanks, i'll be quick  
<hermioneg\> i asked babbage for an extra credit assignment  
<angelinaj\> oh no...  
<hermioneg\> yeah... never again  
<angelinaj\> did she do that thing where she smiles really wide and stares at you?  
<hermioneg\> yes!  
<angelinaj\> you poor dear  
<angelinaj\> anyway, how can i help?  
<hermioneg\> she asked for a short essay on the RMQSTE  
<hermioneg\> but i couldn't make heads or tails of it  
<angelinaj\> that's a prickly subject for sure  
<hermioneg\> i've been working on it for a while, i'm nearly done though  
<hermioneg\> i just can't understand how the malleable logarithmic casing surmounted the pre-famulated amulite in the earlier version  
<angelinaj\> ah! if i remember correctly, it was set up in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan  
<hermioneg\> gosh! that makes so much sense!  
<angelinaj\> the latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented  
<hermioneg\> thank you so much  
<angelinaj\> no problem, always glad to help a fellow tech-head :)
