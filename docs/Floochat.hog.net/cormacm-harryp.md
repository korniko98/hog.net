<cormacm\> harry, any idea why neville was going about without his shoes on all day yesterday?  
<harryp\> not sure, let me ask him, just a sec  
<harryp\> strange  
<harryp\> he doesn't want to talk about it  
<harryp\> let me ask around  
<harryp\> figured it out!  
<harryp\> so according to luna, his shoes got stuck to the floor when he was leaving potions class yesterday morning  
<harryp\> he nearly tripped, and just left them there so he could get to their next class on time  
<cormacm\> typical...
