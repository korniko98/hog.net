<fredw\> finally! we finished our homework  
<ginervaw\> wow, so you two actually did your own homework for once?  
<georgew\> well... no  
<fredw\> it may or may not have involved a few boxes of bertie bott's every flavor beans...  
<ronw\> what? you're not allowed to bribe people to do your homework!  
<ronw\> i mean, that's not fair!  
<georgew\> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
<ronw\> by the way - fred, have you seen my wand anywhere? did i leave it in your room earlier today maybe?  
<fredw\> don't think so  
<ronw\> damn, i must have dropped it yesterday  
<ginervaw\> when we were coming back from the quidditch match?  
<ronw\> yeah - when we got to the entrance hall i realized my pockets were empty  
<georgew\> but when we left the match you definitely still it on you  
<fredw\> yeah, you used it to charm some hotdogs  
<ronw\> right!  
<ronw\> i can't remember what path we took back to the castle though  
<ronw\> so it could be anywhere on the school grounds :(  
<ginervaw\> wait, maybe we can retrace our steps?  
<ronw\> it was really dark out...  
<ginervaw\> most of the way we were heading towards gryffindor tower though, i think  
<ginervaw\> the torches were lit in the girls' dorm windows  
<ronw\> okay that could narrow it down maybe  
<georgew\> oh i think we passed by a building to our left  
<georgew\> can't remember what it was though :\  
<ginervaw\> i'm not sure either  
<ronw\> it was so dark :(  
<ronw\> but i guess that would be a good place to start looking  
<ronw\> might be near that building somewhere, whatever it is  
<ronw\> i guess i'll go look around tomorrow morning before class...
