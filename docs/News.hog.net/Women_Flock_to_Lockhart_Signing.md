# Women Flock to Lockhart Signing  
(1 September 1992)  
*Gilderoy Lockhart, six solid months at the top of the best seller list was in Flourish and Blotts yesterday signing his new book "Magical Me". The bookstore was crammed full of admiring fans most of which were women. Gilderoy Lockhart Wizard Extraordinaire, bewitches and bedazzles us yet again with another toe-nail-bitting account of his heroic encounters with the dark side. Wrestled with werewolves, defied demons, battled bests, Gilderoy's bewildering bravery never ceases to amaze in this magical masterpiece.*
